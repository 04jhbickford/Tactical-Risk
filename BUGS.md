# Tactical Risk — Bug & Debug Log

---

## 7.14.26 — V2.52 pass-and-play / save-state / multiplayer-mode audit

Systematic audit of all play modes and their combinations. Findings:

### Mode support matrix (verified against code)

| Mode | Supported? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pure pass-and-play (1 device, 2+ humans, optional AI) | ✅ | Handoff overlay on every human→human transition (V2.51); localStorage autosave + lobby "My Games → Continue" resume |
| Pure online, live | ✅ | Firestore sync, presence indicators, host runs AI, host-failover if host offline |
| Pure online, async | ✅ | State persists in Firestore indefinitely; rejoin via My Games / Open Games; NEW: tab title flags "● Your turn" for backgrounded tabs |
| Mixed (hotseat pair + remote players) | ❌ by design | One signed-in account = one player; the multiplayer lobby has no "add local player" option, so the scenario cannot be constructed — it fails safely by being unofferable, not silently. Roadmapped in PHASE_4_PLAN.md |
| Reconnect / resume online | ✅ | Rejoin loads latest Firestore state; presence shows the player again; NEW: "X is back online / went offline" toasts |

### Real gaps found and FIXED in V2.52

1. **Online games clobbered the hotseat autosave.** `gameState.autoSave()`
   had no multiplayer guard, so every online turn overwrote the local
   autosave slot — and "My Games → Continue" would then load a broken
   half-multiplayer state with no sync manager. Fixed: autosave is now
   local-games-only (online persistence is Firestore's job).
2. **Setup phases never autosaved.** Autosave only ran on nextTurn/nextPhase
   (playing phase), so a hotseat game closed during capital placement or
   deployment was silently lost despite the resume UI existing. Fixed:
   `placeCapital` and `finishPlacementRound` now autosave.
3. **No async-turn awareness.** A backgrounded/async player had no signal
   it was their turn without switching to the tab. Fixed: browser tab title
   becomes "● Your turn — Tactical Risk" while it's your turn (reset on
   turn end / exit / auth error). Push/email notifications roadmapped.
4. **No connect/disconnect visibility.** Presence dots existed (and only
   work as of the V2.51 rules deploy) but transitions were silent. Fixed:
   "X is back online" / "X went offline" toasts for other players.

### Audit answers with no code change needed

- **Handoff overlay context**: fires only when `!isMultiplayer` and ≥2
  human players — verified in V2.51 (fires per human→human transition in
  hotseat incl. setup phases; never in online or vs-AI games). The
  mixed-device ordering question is moot while mixed mode is unsupported.
- **Mid-turn refresh (online)**: phase/turn transitions push immediately
  (`pushStateNow`); fine-grained actions debounce 100ms, so at most the
  final click before a hard-close is lost. Rejoin restores the latest
  pushed state and correct turn.
- **Write races**: `_doPush` runs in a Firestore transaction — a stale
  client's push aborts and triggers a state reload (V2.49, re-verified).
  Two clients cannot both win the same version number.
- **Stall behavior — documented, not changed**: async games have no turn
  timer (hang forever by design until someone acts; Leave/surrender and
  admin delete are the escape hatches). Live human disconnect mid-turn
  blocks the game until they return (host-failover only covers AI turns).
  Turn timers / skip-votes are roadmapped in PHASE_4_PLAN.md. Hotseat
  idle: no timeout, intentionally.

**OPEN** / **FIXED (pending live verification)** / **VERIFIED**.

## 7.11.26 — V2.46 playtest (2x human, 2x easy AI)

Short round — did not get past deployment.

### Bugs

1. **Open Games is not showing the current game** (though it shows under
   'Your Games'). — reported by Robert
   - Status: **FIXED (pending live verification)**
   - Root cause: the Open Games browser only queries lobbies with
     `status == 'waiting'`. Once a game starts, the lobby flips to
     `'starting'` and disappears from the list entirely. Games in progress
     were only reachable via the separate "My Games" screen.
   - Fix: Open Games now shows a "Your games in progress" section listing
     the player's own active/starting games with a Resume action
     (`multiplayerLobby.js` + `lobbyManager.getMyActiveGames()`).

2. **Unable to get past deployment: game state keeps reverting to a single
   player's turn repeating.** Sequence: Sean capital → Robert capital →
   Sean deployment 1 → Robert deployment 1 → Benson (AI) skipped, back to
   Robert. — reported by Robert/Sean
   - Status: **FIXED (pending live verification)**
   - Root causes (several compounding):
     a. `main.js` created an **AIController on every client**, not just the
        host (`shouldInitAI || hasAIPlayers`). Both human clients tried to
        play Benson's turn.
     b. `multiplayerGuard` used a **cached** `isActivePlayer` flag that lags
        the real turn by the push debounce + network round-trip, so the
        non-host client's AI run was NOT blocked during that window. Two
        clients pushed conflicting states, each stamped `localVersion + 1`,
        clobbering each other → turn reverts/loops.
     c. `syncManager._doPush` blind-wrote with `updateDoc`, so a stale
        client could overwrite a newer remote state.
     d. The prior V2.46 worktree fixes (live-oderId guard, deployment
        skip-loop, `pushStateNow`) were **never merged to main**, so the
        deployed build still had the old bugs.
     e. Committed `main.js` called `playerPanel.setWaitingForSync()`, which
        only existed in an uncommitted diff → TypeError when ending the
        income phase in multiplayer on the deployed build.
   - Fixes: host-only AIController; live oderId turn check in the guard;
     transaction-guarded pushes that refuse to clobber newer state;
     immediate (non-debounced) push on phase/turn transitions; deployment
     round skip-loop; `setWaitingForSync` + missing auth methods
     implemented and committed together.

### Additional defects found during the V2.49 end-to-end audit

4. **Presence (online indicators) never worked.** Presence docs are written
   to the `games/{id}/presence/{userId}` subcollection but firestore.rules
   only covered a top-level `/presence` collection — every write was
   silently denied. Fixed with a subcollection rule. Also: game-doc delete
   rule referenced a nonexistent `hostId` field (admin delete always
   failed) — now admin-email based.
   - Status: **FIXED (pending live verification)**

5. **AI turns crawl/stall when the host's tab is hidden.** Browsers clamp
   chained timers in hidden tabs to ≥1s (eventually 1/minute), so an AI
   turn could take minutes if the host alt-tabbed — reads as "the AI's
   turn is stuck". Fixed: AI skips cosmetic delays and uses microtask
   scheduling while `document.hidden`; a `visibilitychange` listener kicks
   the AI when the tab returns. Verified in-browser: hidden-tab AI turns
   now complete in under a second.
   - Status: **FIXED (verified locally)**

6. **Game stalls forever if the host disconnects during an AI turn.**
   No other client was allowed to run AI. Fixed: host-failover — when
   presence marks the host offline, the first online non-surrendered human
   in turn order takes over AI duty (safe under the new transaction-guarded
   pushes). Eliminated players (no territories, no units) are also now
   skipped by turn advance so an absent wiped-out player can't block the
   game, and last-player-standing ends the game.
   - Status: **FIXED (needs live 2-client verification)**

### V2.49 end-to-end verification (local, 1 human + 1 easy AI)

Full game loop driven in-browser with zero console errors: lobby setup →
random turn order → AI capital auto-placement → human capital → 5
interleaved deployment rounds (AI ↔ human, skip-loop verified) →
transition to playing phase → human full turn → AI full turn (all 7
phases) → round wrap → Round 2. Multiplayer-specific paths (Firestore
sync, surrender, Open Games) still need a live 2-account session.

### Notes / feature requests

3. **'Your Games' needs a way to exit (or surrender) a game in progress.**
   — requested by Robert
   - Status: **IMPLEMENTED (pending live verification)**
   - Each game row in "My Games" now has a Leave button: confirms, marks
     the player surrendered, neutralizes their territories/units, advances
     the turn if it was theirs, removes the game from their list, and ends
     the game if fewer than 2 players (or no humans) remain.
